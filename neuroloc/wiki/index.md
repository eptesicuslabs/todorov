## current project-state analyses (synthesis/)

all 25 articles in `synthesis/` are the load-bearing project-level
reasoning documents. one is superseded, twenty-four are current.

- [[synthesis/substrate_requires_architectural_change]] — the
  post-run-3 analysis after the cognition corpus returned 0% passkey.
  the canonical reference for why the next paid run needs an
  architectural intervention, not another training-corpus change.
  ranks five candidate interventions (A-E). supersedes the "next paid
  run needs a different corpus" stance in `training_objective_vs_architectural_goal`.
- [[synthesis/training_objective_vs_architectural_goal]] — the
  root-cause analysis after five paid runs on fineweb-edu. reasoning
  structure intact; its proposed discriminant (cognition corpus) was
  executed as run3 and returned 0%, which triggered the next article
  above. supersedes `linear_attention_retrieval_wall`.
- [[synthesis/phase1_evaluation_surface_for_neural_models]] — the
  current cpu-first evaluation method for the backlog track. defines
  phase 1 as state + action rather than next-token prediction and
  records the implemented `biology_phase1` symbolic battery now wired
  into `phase1_nm`.
- [[synthesis/synthetic_shared_world_bridge]] — the current phase-2
  extension rule. keeps image, audio, and later multimodal work tied
  to one exact latent world instead of stacking separate benchmarks.
- [[synthesis/research_implications_for_neural_model_direction]] — the
  current ranked summary of what the 2026-04-23 research pass changes
  for the backlog and what it explicitly does not authorize.
- [[synthesis/indexed_reconstruction_compression]] — the current
  compact-handle plus reconstruction direction after the source pass
  on cellular state, synaptic capacity, compression, and model-native
  evaluation gaps.
- [[synthesis/beyond_next_token_for_neural_models]] — the external-ai
  synthesis on why latent state, action, bounded memory, and planning
  are the more relevant comparison frame than output-sequence modeling.
- [[synthesis/world_models_imagination_and_planning]] — the local
  translation of world-model and latent-rollout work into the project's
  state-plus-action framing.
- [[synthesis/working_memory_as_controlled_access]] — working memory as
  routing and access control rather than passive short-term storage.
- [[synthesis/attention_as_precision_and_routing]] — attention as
  control, precision, and routing rather than only token retrieval.
- [[synthesis/cross_scale_building_blocks_for_biological_computation]] —
  the cross-scale synthesis from molecules through systems to reusable
  computational primitives.
- [[synthesis/cellular_molecular_computational_primitives]] — the
  cellular and molecular mechanisms most plausibly reusable as control
  or memory primitives.
- [[synthesis/canonical_visual_narratives_neuroscience]] — canonical
  neuroscience visuals selected for stable reuse in the wiki and the
  curriculum.
- [[synthesis/canonical_visual_narratives_mind_and_memory]] — canonical
  visuals for indexing, replay, and mind-structure narratives.
- [[synthesis/canonical_visual_narratives_world_models]] — canonical
  visuals for latent-world, planning, and beyond-autoregression stories.
- [[synthesis/visual_grammar_for_wiki_and_curriculum]] — the visual
  style guide for locally recreated diagrams and figures.
- [[synthesis/slot_memory_design]] — slot memory substrate design
  and its paid-run empirical status (now three paid runs deep)
- [[synthesis/correction_field_memory]] — prediction-residual value storage

- [[synthesis/timescale_separation]] — matrix memory / mamba / compressed-attention timescale split
- [[synthesis/linear_attention_retrieval_wall]] — superseded. retained for evidence continuity.

## teaching curriculum (2026-04-17, active workstream)

**the project's active workstream is the teaching PDF curriculum** specified in the plan file at `~/.claude/plans/compressed-dancing-haven.md`. paid compute is paused indefinitely; the architectural-intervention track is held in the research backlog until the curriculum completes. the curriculum specifies 36 chapters across 6 phases at 20-25 pages per chapter in English LaTeX:

- phase 1 (ch. 1-8): foundations of math — numbers, change, accumulation, vectors, matrices, multi-dimensional change, probability, information
- phase 2 (ch. 9-14): foundations of biology — cells, electricity, action potentials, synapses, compartmental neurons, circuits
- phase 3 (ch. 15-20): computation in the brain — what neurons compute, population coding, plasticity, cortex, hippocampus, consolidation
- phase 4 (ch. 21-26): math for machine learning — loss, gradient descent, backpropagation, neural networks, recurrence, attention
- phase 5 (ch. 27-32): advanced architectures and compression — associative memory, modern Hopfield, fast-weight memory, sparse/quantized coding, generative memory, the six-mechanism compression thesis
- phase 6 (ch. 33-36): paper implementation — how to read a paper, modern Hopfield from Ramsauer 2020, Titans from the paper, the project's slot memory from scratch

per-chapter production protocol: outline → user approval → parallel research agents (wiki + cited papers + classical textbooks + online resources + reference implementations + recent papers) → prosecutor agents validate research → LaTeX draft → prosecutor on draft → user review → revision → finalized PDF → next chapter. naming rule: published-technique names only when quoting external sources or naming external paper's architectures; the project's own components use the glossary terms (`matrix memory`, `compressed attention`, `slot memory`, `output gate`, `surprise ratio`). full detail in the plan file and in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` section "curriculum track".

backlog note: when the architecture track resumes, it no longer starts
from a blank "define the battery" state. the starting point is the
implemented symbolic `biology_phase1` battery summarized in
`synthesis/phase1_evaluation_surface_for_neural_models.md`, followed by
the synthetic shared-world extension in
`synthesis/synthetic_shared_world_bridge.md`.
