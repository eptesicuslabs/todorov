# world models imagination and planning

status: current (as of 2026-04-23).

## thesis

imagination is best treated as latent-state simulation, not as surface generation. the strongest alignment between biology and modern ai is:

- indexed or bound memory supplies the relevant state fragments
- replay and reinstatement reconstruct context
- a latent model rolls the state forward or sideways under hypothetical actions or constraints
- planning reads out the useful consequences

that unifies recollection, imagination, and counterfactual reasoning more cleanly than next-token continuation does.

## biological side

- hippocampal indexing and replay support reconstruction from sparse cues
- replay appears to support both consolidation and prospective sequence use
- memory and imagination impairments overlap in hippocampal damage

## ai side

- world-model families learn belief state and action-conditioned dynamics
- task-relevant latent planning often outperforms reconstruction-heavy objectives when control is the goal
- latent-target learning families provide a better state-formation path than next-token prediction alone

## what this changes

future backlog theory should treat imagination as a state-space operation. that means:

- no language bottleneck by default
- no requirement that reasoning be externally verbalized
- explicit separation between state learning, dynamics learning, and planning use

## what remains speculative

- replay-as-compiler as the dominant story
- one unified memory-plus-world-model architecture for every future phase
