## what is neuroloc

neuroloc is a computational neuroscience wiki built to support the design of brain-inspired neural architectures. it contains 61 mechanism articles, 28 bridge documents (25 current + 3 legacy-title redirects), 15 comparison analyses (14 current + 1 legacy-title redirect), 24 synthesis pages, 49 research shelves, and 33 entity notes. every article is written to be useful to engineers, not just neuroscientists.

## who this is for

you are an ML engineer. you know transformers, attention, gradient descent, and linear algebra. you know nothing about neuroscience. you want to understand which biological principles can make neural architectures better -- and which are irrelevant distractions.

## what you will learn

- how neurons compute: spikes, thresholds, membrane potentials, and why they matter for architecture design
- how synapses learn: Hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and their relationship to the delta rule and linear attention
- how the brain encodes information: sparse coding, population coding, and the tradeoffs between sparsity and capacity
- how the brain predicts: predictive coding, precision weighting, and how they differ from next-token prediction
- how the brain organizes computation: cortical columns, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and the canonical microcircuit
- where biological analogies help and where they mislead: 15 adversarial analyses that separate genuine insight from superficial resemblance

## how to read this wiki

use [[Home]] as the landing page, [[INDEX]] as the flat catalog, and this page as the guided reading path.

start with the introductory material:

1. this page (you are here)
2. [[the_brain_in_one_page]] -- the 80/20 overview of neuroscience for ML engineers
3. [[neuroscience_for_ml_engineers]] -- deeper treatment of the concepts most relevant to architecture design
4. [[canonical_visual_narratives_neuroscience]] and [[canonical_visual_narratives_mind_and_memory]] -- the fastest visual pass through the highest-leverage stories

then read the bridge documents. these connect biological mechanisms to todorov code. each one asks "is this biological analogy real?" and gives an honest answer:

5. [[plasticity_to_matrix_memory_delta_rule]] -- is the matrix-memory delta rule Hebbian learning?
6. [[sparse_coding_to_ternary_spikes]] -- are ternary spikes sparse coding?
7. [[energy_efficiency_to_ternary_spikes]] -- do ternary spikes actually save energy?
8. [[dendritic_computation_to_swiglu]] -- is SwiGLU analogous to dendritic gating?
9. [[state_action_memory_architecture_direction]] -- what the newer research cluster changes about the backlog direction
10. the remaining bridge documents in the [[INDEX]]

then explore individual mechanism articles as needed. use the [[glossary]] when you encounter unfamiliar terms.

## the key insight

this wiki began as a search for biological justification of todorov's architecture. it found something more interesting: most biological analogies in todorov are superficial.

the bridge and comparison work showed that:

- ternary spikes are not sparse coding. cortical neurons fire at 1-5% rates. todorov spikes fire at 41%. the mechanism is useful but the analogy is weak.
- the matrix-memory delta rule is not STDP. it uses an outer product (Hebbian), but there is no timing dependence, no asymmetric learning window, no causal inference.
- LayerNorm is not divisive normalization. the mathematical form is similar but the computational role is different.
- the residual stream is not a global workspace. it is a shared bus, not a selective broadcasting mechanism.
- Mamba3 complex rotation is not oscillatory dynamics. it serves positional encoding, not temporal coordination.
- cortical layers are not transformer layers. the connectivity, cell types, and computational roles are fundamentally different.

the architecture works not because it faithfully reproduces biology, but because the biological constraints it borrows -- ternary quantization, recurrent state accumulation, adaptive thresholds, outer-product associative memory -- are independently useful engineering choices.

the one genuine biological correspondence: the outer-product associative memory in matrix memory (S_t = alpha * S_{t-1} + beta * k * v^T) genuinely mirrors Hebbian learning. the outer product k * v^T is the same operation the brain uses to bind key-value pairs in memory. this is not an analogy. it is the same math.

the newer 2026-04-23 research pass adds a second lesson on top of that adversarial cleanup. once the superficial analogies are stripped away, the most interesting remaining directions are not "make it more brain-like" in general. they are more specific:

- multi-timescale state
- indexing plus replay
- routing and gating as control primitives
- branch-local or compartment-local computation
- latent state-action models as the strongest external-ai comparison frame

that cluster is now recorded in the new synthesis and bridge pages, and it is the right place to look when the architecture backlog resumes after the curriculum.
