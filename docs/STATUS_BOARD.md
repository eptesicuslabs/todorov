# status board

canonical persistent project state lives in `neuroloc/wiki/PROJECT_PLAN.md`. that file is updated whenever the project state changes (a run starts, a run completes, a hypothesis is added or falsified, the experimental method changes, a new project term enters the glossary, a prior research question is answered). this status board is a per-run summary; PROJECT_PLAN.md is the structural plan and the entry point for any new agent picking up the project.

## current phase: teaching curriculum (2026-04-17)

**the project's active workstream is the teaching PDF curriculum** specified in the plan file at `~/.claude/plans/compressed-dancing-haven.md`. paid compute is paused indefinitely. the architectural-intervention track (A-E candidates in `neuroloc/wiki/synthesis/substrate_requires_architectural_change.md`) remains in the research backlog but is NOT the active workstream; it becomes active again only when the curriculum has produced enough fluency to choose and execute an intervention independently.

the curriculum specifies 36 chapters across 6 phases (math fundamentals → biology fundamentals → computation in the brain → ML math → advanced architectures and compression → paper implementation) at 20-25 pages per chapter in English LaTeX, written in the pedagogical voice of `/Projects/dzipobel` adapted to English. each chapter is produced with a strict protocol: outline → user approval → parallel research agents (wiki + cited papers + classical textbooks + online resources + reference implementations + recent papers) → prosecutor agents validate research → LaTeX draft → prosecutor agents validate draft → user review → revision → finalized PDF → next chapter.

while the curriculum is the active workstream, no paid compute run is authorised. the next paid run returns only after curriculum completion AND an architectural intervention has been selected and cpu-validated per the pre-pivot experimental method (which is preserved in PROJECT_PLAN.md below the curriculum pivot section). the user will execute chapter production themselves from the plan file.

current curriculum status (2026-04-22): chapter 1 is review-ready at `pdf_curriculum/chapters/ch_01_what_a_number_means/` and chapter 2 is outline-only awaiting approval at `pdf_curriculum/chapters/ch_02_how_things_change/ch_02_outline.md`.

the prior phase (neural machine research) and its six-paid-run history is preserved below as historical record. pre-pivot phase summaries below should be read as historical snapshots, not as the active program surface; some older phase-3 conclusions were later qualified as confounded or vacuous in the bug history and canonical state files.

## prior phase: neural machine research (neuroloc)

## status: run3_cognition_phase1 complete (2026-04-17). val_bpb 6.3519 (plateaued at the alphabet prior from step 150 and never descended), passkey 0/100 at 256 and 1024 (partial eval — pod stopped by user before further eval). SIX paid runs all returning 0% passkey at 256 across two substrates (matrix and slot), two retention regimes (broken inherited and fixed alpha_log_mean=5.0), and now two corpora (fineweb-edu natural text and synthetic cognition). this run executed the discriminant proposed in `neuroloc/wiki/synthesis/training_objective_vs_architectural_goal.md`: a corpus where retrieval is explicit 50% of training. the article predicted that if phase one produced zero passkey on synthetic data, the substrate could not be trained by sgd at this configuration and the architecture needed deeper changes. phase one produced zero passkey. the architecture-cannot-be-trained-by-sgd branch fires. diagnosis is no longer "training objective mismatch" (that was the prior-run hypothesis) but "this substrate does not learn retrieval under sgd with these initialisations and this loss, even when the loss directly rewards retrieval". analysis at `neuroloc/wiki/synthesis/substrate_requires_architectural_change.md`, which ranks five candidate architectural interventions: (A) output gate init 0 instead of -4 (gate sigmoid(-4)=0.018 appears to be a fixed point of SGD, mean gate stayed at 0.018 through two paid runs), (B) auxiliary retrieval loss on MARK_QUERY-following positions at 10-100x weighting, (C) orthogonal prototype key init to break one-slot softmax collapse, (D) warm start from hand-placed (key, value) pairs, (E) substrate replacement (titans fast-weight, larimar, differentiable kv table). A-C are single-file changes that could bundle into one paid run; expected outcome is still 0% passkey, above 1% is the discriminator. D and E require the cpu simulation gate A+B+C pattern before paid compute. another paid run with no substrate changes is strictly predicted to produce 0% passkey and must not be authorised. run card at `neuroloc/wiki/tests/run3_cognition_phase1_results.md`.

## prior status: run2_slot_memory_retention_fixed complete (2026-04-15)

val_bpb 1.4777, passkey 0/100 at 256 and 1024 (partial eval — pod stopped by user before passkey@4096 / selective_copy / structure_probe completed). FIVE paid runs all returning 0% passkey at 256 across two substrates (matrix and slot) and two retention regimes (broken inherited and fixed alpha_log_mean=5.0). diagnosis at that point: the language-modelling training objective on fineweb-edu does not exercise the memory substrate, so gradient descent collapses it to inactive (mean output gate stayed at 0.018 throughout the 4000-step run) and never learns to use it. cpu gates A and B prove the slot mechanism CAN retrieve when addresses are placed by hand. the proposed discriminant (synthetic cognition corpus) was run as run3_cognition_phase1 and produced the same 0%, superseding this hypothesis with the architectural-change one above. first launch attempt of run2 fell through to the python recurrent loop because `flash-linear-attention` was missing from the pod (now pinned in `requirements.txt` commit `edcfe5d`, mistake at `wiki/mistakes/run2_slot_memory_fla_silent_fall_through.md`). run card at `neuroloc/wiki/tests/run2_slot_memory_retention_fixed_results.md`. analysis at `neuroloc/wiki/synthesis/training_objective_vs_architectural_goal.md` (the article was updated 2026-04-17 with the run3 result; its reasoning structure is correct, its predicted discriminant came back negative).

## prior status: run2_slot_memory first launch (2026-04-15)

val_bpb 1.5107, passkey 0/100 at every tested length. FOUR paid runs at 0% passkey before the retention-fix relaunch. run 2 first-launch failure was a SELF-INFLICTED CONFIG BUG — the slot preset inherited `alpha_log_mean=-0.5` from Config defaults, reproducing the exact state-evaporation failure mode documented in `wiki/synthesis/linear_attention_retrieval_wall.md` four days earlier by the same author who built the slot preset. mistake documented in `wiki/mistakes/run2_slot_memory_decay_copy_paste.md`. fix committed as `7abb781`. structural guard `_assert_preset_retention_safe` enforces explicit `alpha_log_mean` at config resolution so the bug class is impossible to reintroduce by silence.

## god_run_v2: god_machine.py re-run with all 17 F + 14 G prosecutor fixes (2026-04-12)

h200, 283m params, 4000 steps on fineweb-edu byte-level, 131m tokens, 59 min runtime.
all 17 F1-F17 + 14 G1-G14 prosecutor findings fixed before launch. critical fix: F1
replaced `torch.sigmoid(log_alpha_eff)` with `torch.exp(log_alpha_eff)` so recurrent path
matches FLA's `exp(g)` convention for log-space gates (prior broken math gave ~28% wrong
alpha_eff at default init). F2 gated `running_state_norm` EMA on `self.training`. F3/F5
merged spike_stats and val_result into jsonl via loop (fixed the class-wide regression of
the step-logger bug). F10 low-rank factorized imag_filter/pc_head (d→64→d). F11 uint8
ByteDataset. 12 more findings covering smoke tests, resume correctness, load errors,
dead code, misleading metrics. cpu oracle verifies alpha_eff math passes before launch.

**training: final val_bpb 1.4453 (+0.050 vs v1's 1.3950), 0.404x vs transformer**

**eval: retrieval 0% at every tested length**

| task | result (100 trials) |

perplexity at length: 1.9254 → 1.8941 → 1.5373 → 1.4776 → 1.4192 (monotonic, attention
uses context). delta state structure probe: mean_structure_ratio 0.977, pairwise_cos
0.003 (statistically noise, not trained memory).

**verdict: F1 math fix was not the root cause. the tested 5-feature bundle still failed
verbatim memory.** external review (2026-04-12) identified 8 candidate contributing
mechanisms. the two strongest current review findings are: (1) k-WTA 20% on keys likely
destroys the address space (only ~13/64 key dims survive, Hopfield capacity drops from ~9
to ~2 patterns per head); (2) delta erasure with sparse keys likely leaves ghost content
in the zeroed dimensions. 6 supporting review findings: imagination probe may create a
gradient bypass that competes with the delta memory, BCM EMA half-life 69 steps may be too
slow, multi-compartment SwiGLU may reduce effective width, PC head may add loss drag,
FLA/recurrent numerical drift may compound during chunked eval, q/k normalization timing
differs between paths. full detail in `neuroloc/output/god_run_v2/run_card.md`.

**revised path forward** (blueprint.md updated):
- **run 1 baseline dense**: `god_machine.py` preset `run1_baseline_noerasure`; dense k/v,
  no delta erasure, non-FLA path, no BCM, no multi-compartment, no imagination, no PC head.
  prelaunch gate: short h200 timing/oom benchmark at full batch/seq on the recurrent path. the full launch now refuses to start without the recorded benchmark manifest in the same output root, rejects resumed benchmark replays, locks the official full run to the canonical 4000-step config, requires the current device to match the benchmarked hardware profile, binds the gate to the recorded benchmark artifacts and git working-tree fingerprint, and forbids FineWeb fallback under the canonical preset name. this is a local structural/provenance guard, not cryptographic attestation.
  hard retrieval gate after the full run: nonzero passkey at 256, persisted as `retrieval_gate`
  in the run results. inconclusive eval now fails closed instead of exiting zero.
- **if run 1 still returns 0% passkey**: run one slower static-retention ablation with erasure still off before declaring the base mechanism suspect. the standalone decay sweep at `d_head=64` only reopens exact-query 32-pattern recall around `decay=0.90`, while the current static init starts much lower.
- run 2: implement and smoke a value-only 50% k-wta preset before launch. current checked-in `god_machine.py` still sparsifies keys and values together when k-wta is enabled.
- run 3: after run 2, implement and smoke bcm controls for momentum 0.95 and init `running_state_norm=0.01` before launch. current checked-in code still hardcodes the old 0.99/1.0 behavior.
- run 4: reintroduce erasure only as an explicit post-baseline ablation after dense-key retrieval is validated
- not added until validated: imagination, multi-compartment, PC head, any k-WTA on keys

## god_run: god_machine.py first run (2026-04-11)

h200, 283m params (282,953,496), 4000 steps on fineweb-edu byte-level, 131,072,000 tokens, seed 42.
all 5 blueprint features active: k-wta 20% rate-coded compression, delta-rule erasure,
bcm-adaptive alpha (gamma=0.3), multi-compartment swiglu (k=4), compressed attention via sdpa.
plus always-on imagination probe (learned query into delta state with gated residual, now
low-rank factorized to ~131k params per layer) and per-layer predictive coding diagnostic head.

val_bpb 1.3950 (final). bpb_ratio 0.390x vs 3.58 transformer baseline at matched pipeline.
smooth monotonic decrease: 2.381 → 2.07 → 1.94 → 1.87 → 1.81 → 1.75 → 1.71 → 1.67 → 1.62 →
1.57 → 1.52 → 1.50 → 1.48 → 1.46 → 1.44 → 1.43 → 1.42 → 1.41 → 1.40 → 1.3950.
training loss final 0.9535 at step 3950. throughput ~45,500 tok/s steady. total 3166s (~53 min).
firing rate 0.200 exactly throughout (k-wta target met). no dead neurons.

**retrieval failed at every tested length (n=20 per cell, 95% wilson upper ~14%):**

passkey  @256: 0/20  passkey  @1024: 0/20  passkey  @4096: 0/20
copy     @256: 0/20  copy     @512:  0/20  copy     @1024: 0/20  copy @2048: 0/20

perplexity-at-length (monotonic decrease, attention path uses context):
bpb@256=1.9354  bpb@512=1.8437  bpb@1024=1.4909  bpb@2048=1.4110  bpb@4096=1.3751

delta state structure probe (closed-gate readout with novel keys, NOT image generation):
mean_structure_ratio=0.981, mean_pairwise_cos=-0.003, random_pairwise_cos=0.000.
state is near-orthogonal across 24 delta layers. this is NOT the structured-interpolation
signature (cosine ~0.93) that exp_008 reported. the delta memory accumulated high frobenius
norm but pairwise-orthogonal state that functions as noise, not content-addressable storage.

**diagnosis**: the compressed-attention+mlp path learned to fit the next-byte distribution
(bpb 1.395). the delta-rule memory state is noise. k-wta 20% + delta erasure + bcm alpha +
imagination probe combined so that verbatim retrieval was destroyed while statistical
distribution-fitting worked. this is exactly the lossy-mechanism failure mode that
`wiki/synthesis/compression_beyond_quantization.md` predicts: preserved statistical fit,
destroyed verbatim memory.

**17 prosecutor findings F1-F17 applied before re-run:**

- f1 (p0): bcm train/eval path divergence. recurrent path computed live-state alpha_eff
  per timestep; fla path used running_state_norm buffer. fixed by aligning recurrent path
  to use `_effective_log_alpha` which reads running_state_norm.
- f2 (p0): running_state_norm buffer mutated during eval. fixed with self.training gate.
- f3 (p1): history dict was a second cherry-pick site (class-level regression of the
  step-logger bug). fixed via setdefault loop that merges all spike_stats keys.
- f4 (p1): collect_god_metrics produced length-inconsistent per_layer arrays. fixed by
  pre-allocating [None]*n_layers lists.
- f5 (p1): other metrics_logger sites still cherry-picked val_result. fixed via loop merge.
- f6 (p1): passkey/copy 20 trials was too few (95% wilson upper 14% for 0/20). fixed to 100.
- f7 (p2): load_state_dict strict=False swallowed errors. fixed to raise on missing keys.
- f8 (p2): compartment guard was dead. fixed to check correct aux key name.
- f9 (p2): smoke-test required_god_keys was a hardcoded 9-key list. fixed to derive from aux.
- f10 (p2): imag_filter 1m params * 24 layers = 24m always-active dead weight. fixed to
  low-rank factorization (~131k params/layer). same for pc_head. added post-val warning
  if imag_ratio_mean < 0.02.
- f11 (p2): bytedataset materialized int64 (8x ram). fixed to keep uint8, cast per-slice.
- f12 (p2): no resume correctness test. added _test_resume_correctness() to smoke_test.
- f13 (p3): dead _parallel_no_erasure code. removed; all non-fla paths go through recurrent.
- f14 (p3): non-causal attn_entropy probe with T<=512 gate. removed.
- f15 (p3): hardcoded zero dead_pct/saturated_pct/per_layer_dead_count. removed.
- f16 (p3): dead imports (field), SEED constant, TernaryQuantizer, AdaptiveSpike. removed.
- f17 (p3): per-timestep state.norm O(H*D*D). fixed via f1 (alpha_eff hoisted).

local working-tree note: the reviewed `god_machine.py` currently contains a reintroduced, unused `TernaryQuantizer` / `AdaptiveSpike` pair near the top of the file. that is outside the selected run-1 launch surface and not part of the archived f16 fix record above.

**renamed**: run_imagination_test → run_delta_state_structure_probe. "imagination" was a
misleading metaphor for what is actually a state-structure probe; the byte-level text model
has no image generation capability.

**class-level telemetry gate**: smoke_test now writes collect_god_metrics output through a
real MetricsLogger to a tempfile, reads it back via json.loads, and asserts every enabled
feature's aux keys round-trip through disk. any future regression that drops metrics fails
smoke test before launch. required_god_keys is derived programmatically from aux.

artifacts: `neuroloc/output/god_run/` (eval_suite.json, metadata.json, stdout.log,
metrics.jsonl, results.json). run card: `neuroloc/output/god_run/run_card.md`.

**what happened next**: `god_run_v2` re-ran `god_machine.py` with all F1-F17 fixes and full
telemetry. the result stayed at 0% retrieval, so this archived branch is closed; the live
next-step plan is the no-erasure baseline summarized near the top of this file.
